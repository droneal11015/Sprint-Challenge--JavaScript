What matters most to me within a company is great leadership, recognition, mentorship opportunities, and benefits. A great leader, manager, supervisor, whatever the title is makes for better employees. They establish loyalty to the company, have a great positivity that sets examples for their employees, and make their employees feel like people instead of just a number. "People quit bosses, not jobs". Recognition for hard work makes anyone feel good, it boosts your self esteem and confidence, and makes you want to continue to do more. Mentorship opportunities allow you to learn and grow, keeping you from becoming stagnant in your workplace. Finally, benefits are always great, especially those like health insurance. We all need that, and being allowed to enjoy time off every once in awhile keeps the mind refreshed and helps employees keep from getting burnt out.
